# Multi-Room-Security-System
The main purpose of our project was to develop a security system using two or more Arduino sensors. To accomplish this, we developed a software to allow a user (for example a security officer) to interact with a web interface through their browser in order to prime one or more Arduino sensors connected to Raspberry Pi's. Then, whenever a sensor is activated (for example, a burglar makes a noise in one of the rooms being monitored), the user will be notified by an alarm sound from their computer and a notification on their web interface of the room currently being accessed. The user can then deal with the intruder and then reset the system easily from that same web interface.
